Radio-Engine
========================================

A radio player that uses:
- The Echo Nest to generate a dynamic seed-song catalog playlist that is DMCA-compliant and has adventurouness = 0;
- Rdio and Deezer to stream the songs;
- A few ready-made playlists to simulate the (situational) Taste Profile of 2 different artists consisting of a solo artist and a 3-member band.

The user should be able to:
- Switch between Rdio and Deezer for the source for their music;
- Equalize the Taste Profiles using an integer from 0 to 5 (1 is the default and 0 means it doesn't take it into account to generate the playlist);
- Choose a situation;
- Allow for studio and/or live songs;
- Skip songs, favorite artists and songs, ban artists and songs, and rate songs from 0 to 10.
