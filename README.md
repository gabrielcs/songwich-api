Radio-Engine
========================================

A radio player that uses:
(1) The Echo Nest to generate a dynamic seed-song catalog playlist that is DMCA-compliant;
(2) Rdio and Deezer to stream the songs;
(3) A few of Tunigo's playlists to simulate the (situational) Taste Profile of 3 different people.

The user should be able to 
(1) Switch between Rdio and Deezer for the source for their music;
(2) Equalize the Taste Profiles using an integer from 0 to 5 (1 is the default and 0 means it doesn't take it into account to generate the radio);
(3) Choose 3 types of situation between time of day, day of week, what you're doing;
(4) Allow for studio and/or live songs;
(5) Skip songs, favorite artists and songs, ban artists and songs, and rate songs from 0 to 10.

The Taste Profiles will be:
